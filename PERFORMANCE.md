*Console log time metrics.*

## Mobile Performance
1. Lowered map tile quality on slow connections
2. Smoothed position updates while dragging the marker
3. Improved touch interaction

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Debouncing
Added a debounce to limit how often the location gets saved while dragging the marker. This cuts down on unnecessary updates and keeps performance smooth.

#### 2. Asynchronous Loading with PartyTown
PartyTown to handle tasks, which lightened the main threadâ€™s load and boosted responsiveness and performance.

### Performance Test
Used the Lighthouse tool to test the performance of the application.
