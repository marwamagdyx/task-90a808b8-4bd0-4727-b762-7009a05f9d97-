# Implementation Strategies
 
## Map Implementation
- Using OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js for map rendering
- Implementing draggable markers for location selection
- Efficient map tile loading and caching

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of map components and tiles
- Debounced position updates
- Efficient state management using Svelte stores
- Progressive loading of map features

## Storage Strategy
- Primary: LocalStorage for persistent storage
- Asynchronous storage operations to prevent UI blocking
- Partytown for improved performance

## Mobile-First Approach
- Responsive design using viewport units
- Touch-friendly interactions optimized for mobile
- Performance optimization for slower devices
- Efficient map tile caching for offline capability
